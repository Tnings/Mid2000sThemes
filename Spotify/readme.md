This theme was made to look like Spotify when it released in 2008 and was made to be loaded through [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/). To install it, move the folder titled _2008_ into your Themes folder and the _oldspot.js_ file into your Extensions folder. Then edit your config to include those files in the themes and extensions respectfully.
